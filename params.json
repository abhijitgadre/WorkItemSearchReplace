I've had an idea for a Team Foundation Server (TFS) utility brewing for a while. Usually I publish my TFS utilities as command-line or standalone desktop applications; this sample has inspired me to create a utility with tighter Visual Studio integration.  Armed with the sample and the Visual Studio 2012 Software Development Kit (available from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30668)), I started hacking. You can find the finished extension on the [Visual Studio Gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/ef02938d-7fb7-44ef-9040-798668773306).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
